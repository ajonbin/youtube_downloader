- Enhanced error messages and logging
- Implemented best practices for Python code
- Set up version control with Git

### Network and SSL Handling
- Implemented robust SSL error handling
- Added custom SSL context creation
- Implemented multiple fallback mechanisms
  - Primary download using yt-dlp
  - Secondary download using pytube
  - Custom SSL context when needed
- Added retry mechanisms for network issues
- Implemented session management for better stability
- Added detailed error reporting and recovery

## Technical Challenges Solved

### SSL and Network Issues
- **Problem**: SSL verification errors during downloads
  ```
  [SSL: UNEXPECTED_EOF_WHILE_READING] EOF occurred in violation of protocol (_ssl.c:1007)
  ```
- **Causes**:
  - Network instability
  - Proxy interference
  - SSL certificate issues
  - Server connection limits
- **Solutions Implemented**:
  1. Custom SSL Context
     ```python
     def create_ssl_context():
         ctx = ssl.create_default_context()
         ctx.check_hostname = False
         ctx.verify_mode = ssl.CERT_NONE
         return ctx
     ```
  2. Session Management
     ```python
     session = requests.Session()
     session.verify = False
     ```
  3. Multiple Download Methods
     - Primary: yt-dlp with retry
     - Fallback: pytube with custom SSL handling
  4. Automatic Recovery
     - Retry mechanisms
     - Alternative download paths
     - Format fallbacks

### Download Reliability
- Implemented multiple retry attempts
- Added format fallback options
- Created download resumption capability
- Added progress tracking and reporting
- Implemented smart file existence checking
